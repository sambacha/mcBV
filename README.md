# About

mcBV is a solver for (existential) bit-vector formulas (SMT QF_BV) based on the
[mcSAT framework](http://dblp.org/rec/conf/vmcai/MouraJ13).

The technical aspects and experimental results are described in:
Zeljic, Wintersteiger, Ruemmer: [Deciding Bit-Vector Formulas with mcSAT]
(http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=264535).
